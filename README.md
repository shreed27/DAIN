# ⚡ DAIN — Decentralized Autonomous Intelligence Network

> _“From intent to execution — coordinated by autonomous agents.”_

---

## 🧠 What is DAIN?

DAIN is an **agent-orchestrated intelligence platform** that coordinates multiple autonomous AI agents to **analyze, decide, and execute on-chain actions** based on high-level user intent.

Instead of building a single “smart bot”, DAIN acts as an **operating system for on-chain agents** — enabling collaboration, routing, intelligence sharing, and execution across decentralized environments.

## 🌐 The Core Idea

Users should not need to understand:
- which DEX to use  
- which route is optimal  
- which signal is trustworthy  
- which agent to call  

They should only express **intent**.

DAIN handles the rest.

---

## 🧩 System Philosophy

Think of DAIN as a **cyberpunk control layer**:

- Humans express intent  
- AI agents negotiate decisions  
- On-chain systems execute outcomes  

All coordinated autonomously.

## 🤖 Agent Roles

DAIN supports **specialized autonomous agents**, including:

- **Trading Agent**  
  Executes on-chain actions with liquidity-aware routing.

- **DEX Agent**  
  Interfaces with decentralized exchanges and optimizes execution paths.

- **OSINT / Intelligence Agent**  
  Ingests off-chain signals and contextual data for decision support.

- **Routing Agent**  
  Selects optimal agents and execution strategies based on intent.

- **Network Agent**  
  Enables secure agent-to-agent communication and coordination.

Agents are independent, composable, and interoperable.

## 🧠 What Makes DAIN Different

Most projects build:
- a single agent  
- a single bot  
- a single router  

DAIN builds:
- **the coordination layer between agents**

Key differences:
- Intent-based interaction (not command-based)
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Off-chain intelligence + on-chain execution
- Modular agent architecture
- Developer-extensible SDK
- Designed as infrastructure, not an app
## 🧪 Example Flow

--- 

**User Intent:**  
> “Swap SOL to USDC with minimal slippage.”

**What happens:**
1. Intent is parsed
2. Router selects relevant agents
3. Intelligence agent evaluates market context
4. Execution agent routes via optimal DEX
5. Transaction is executed on-chain
6. Result is returned to the user

The user never touches low-level complexity.
